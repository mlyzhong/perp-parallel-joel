# perp-parallel-joel

7 June, 2017
About time, it is for me to use git as version control for the simulation project I have been working on with Joel Fajans. This code runs simulations of hbars in ALPHA, with a specific focus on the transfer between perpindicular and parallel modes of energy. Also included (to be documented!) are scripts to analyze the output of the simulations. 

Functionality of code thus far: 
-Record specific trajectories (x(t), v(t) for all timesteps)
-Record E_{\parallel}(t) whenever z(t) crosses 0
-Compute largest Lyapunov exponents (and save them whenever necessary) 
-Records thresholdtimes

Here's to great documentation!!!
